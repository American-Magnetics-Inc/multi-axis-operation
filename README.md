Magnet-DAQ is also open source subject to GPL v3 or later.The Multi-Axis Operation application contains a first revision of a Help file which is fairly complete and should be adequate to understand how to use the application to control a multi-axis system. This application is still a work in progress. There are several features still remaining to implement. *This first release is primarily suited for the manufacturer and system integrators to test the magnet operation. Later features will try to address the needs of a customer base for experimental applications.*## How do I install? ##Pre-compiled, ready-to-use binaries are available in the Downloads section of this repository:* [Installer for 64-bit Microsoft Windows 7 or later](https://bitbucket.org/americanmagneticsinc/multi-axis-operation/downloads/MultiAxis-Setup.msi) - Simply download and run the installer.Installers for 64-bit Linux and macOS may follow at a later date.## How do I compile the source? ##* __Summary of set up__	* Clone or download the source code repository to your local drive.	* *For Windows*: Open the Multi-Axis-Operation.sln file in [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/free-developer-offers/).
